# dylan_themes_over_time

For this passion project, I decided to cluster themes in Bob Dylan's music over time. Bob Dylan is one of my favorite artist's and I wanted to see if machine learning could give me insight into life through his lyrics, since his songs tend to be autobiographical.<br><br>
For my data I used all his songs throughout his career excluding soundtracks and greatest hits albums and I used tfidf to vectorize the songs and nmf to extract topics<br><br>
My conclusion was that due to the complexity of his metaphors and themes it became hard to come up with clear themes. Two that I was able to extract was God and love. I was able to come up with nice visualizations that map these themes throughout his career.

I hope you enjoy the project and feel free to give any feedback you have about how I can improve this project.
